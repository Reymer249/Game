# Educational game

This project is an educational game in topic of computer architecture. More precicely, it considers digital building blocks: number systems, logic arrays and memory arrays. 
The concept is a story about a small Fixit (worker) in the computer, who has to fix the broken parts in the system. \
The player will have five buttons, 4 to move in all directions, and
1 button to interact with parts of the objects. The objects are memory arrays
and logic arrays. Furthermore, it will be some levels about numerical systems
and their problems. These objects are broken, and by fixing these parts of the
object will allow the player to see an informational presentation by its character
on the characteristic of the subtopic which the player is in. When completing all
the characters of the first object, the player can proceed to the second level. To
finish the game the player has to kill the end boss. This is done by answering a
set of multiple-choice questions about the characteristics of the objects.
